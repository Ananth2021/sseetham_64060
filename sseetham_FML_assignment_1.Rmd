setwd("C:/Users/Ananth/OneDrive/Documents/R/win-library/4.0/00LOCK")


setwd("C:/Users/Ananth/OneDrive/Desktop/MSBA Kent/Kent on campus employement/BA LAB/Lab 2")



I have used the data given by professor patuwo in Business Analytics lab sessions for the undegrad students

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/Ananth/OneDrive/Desktop/MSBA Kent/Kent on campus employement/BA LAB/Lab 2")

DS<-read.csv("FML.csv")  # reading data into DS 
DS # displays the content in the excel file
```

```{r}
summary(DS) # descriptive statistics for the excel data 
```
```{r}
summary(DS$Salary) # descriptive statistics for the quantitative data Salary , $ is used to access the column in DS dataframe 

summary(log(DS$Salary)) #data transformation using log function 

```

```{r}
Ftable <- table(DS$Personality) # personalities has categorical data 
Ftable # displays the frequency of the category repeated in the personality & descriptive analysis of categorical data 

Btable <-table(DS$Business) # business is a categorical data 
Btable # displays the frequency of the category in Business column in excel sheet & descriptive analysis of categorical data 

```
```{r}
barplot(DS$Salary,DS$Age) 

plot(DS$Salary,DS$Age) # Scatter plot
